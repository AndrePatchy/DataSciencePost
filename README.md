<h1>Data Science & Machine Learning</h1>
<p>The following projects were developed in the Enterprise Data Science and Analytics Post-Graduation at NOVA Information Management School - University of Lisbon!</p>

<h2>
    <span class="heading">1.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning" target="_blank">Deep Learning</a>
</h2>
<p>Classification and regression problems applying only deep learning algorithms.</p>

<h3>

    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning/Neural%20Net/predict_imdb_reviews.ipynb" target="_blank">Predict IMDB reviews with Neural Networks</a>
</h3>

    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Deep%20Learning/CNN/diabetic_retinopathy_classification.ipynb" target="_blank">Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy with Convolutional Neural Networks</a>
</h3>

<h2>
    <span class="subheading">2.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning" target="_blank">Unsupervised Learning</a>
</h2>

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">2.1.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Unsupervised%20Learning/Deliverables/DSML_202223_Cluster_Group21_Notebook.ipynb" target="_blank">Customer Profiling</a>
</h3>
<p>Using Python we analyzed (data cleaning, data transforming, feature engineering, statistical analysis, PCA) and segmented a customer's database by applying clustering algorithms (k-means, k-modes). The 4 distinct groups identified were personally approached by the marketing team.</p>

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">3.1.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning/Deliverables/DSML_202223_Predictive_Group21_Notebook.ipynb" target="_blank">Predictive Analysis of Customer Response</a>
</h3>
 
Using historical data we did descriptive and prescriptive analytics, (data cleaning, data transforming, feature engineering, statistical analysis, PCA, k-means) and with supervised machine learning algorithms (neural net, support vector machines and logistic regression) we predict the response of a customers database to a new marketing campaign. The results are the predictions of each customer response to X marketing campaign. 

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">3.2.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Curbing%20Employee%20Attrition" target="_blank">Curbing Employee Attrition</a>
</h3>

Using Python (numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn), we did both descriptive analytics (data cleaning, data transforming, feature engineering, statistical analysis, PCA, MCA) and predictive analytics to find patterns and proactively identify potential employee attrition. Data-driven actions could be made regarding the 3 distinct groups identified with similar patterns according to the features that impact employee attrition. 

<h2>4. Python</h2>

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">4.1.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/python" target="_blank">Python Basics</a>
</h3>

Explore core building blocks of programming, focusing on variables, data structures, and their manipulation.

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">4.2.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/python" target="_blank">K-Means from scratch</a>
</h3>

Build k-means algorithm step by step.

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">4.3.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/python/webscrapping_project" target="_blank">Webscrapping Project</a>
</h3>

The project’s goal is to collect the prices of the 25 items included in the Food Baskets: Operational Program to Support the Neediest People. We got the data of grocery products information with 16866 products and 8 features from 2 Portuguese supermarkets. By finding the best bargains among retailers, our analysis can assist customers in saving money. We divided the project into 3 major parts:

    2.1. Data Collection;
    2.2. Data Cleaning;
    2.3. Data Visualization and Analysis.

<h2>5. t-SQL</h2>

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">5.1.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/blob/main/t-sql/auction_script.sql" target="_blank">Online auction process in SQL</a>
</h3>

Using t-SQL we built an auction schema in a CosmosDB database, created stored procedures for adding products to auction, bidding on a product, removing a product from auction, updating a product’s auction status and creating lists of product’s bidding history. 

<h3>
    <span class="subheading">5.2.</span>
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrePatchy/nova-ims/tree/main/t-sql/part_2" target="_blank">Brick-and-mortar stores</a>
</h3>

A comprehensive analysis of the database to develop data-driven arguments for a final proposition of the two best cities for Adventure Works to open the first 2 brick-and-mortar stores.
