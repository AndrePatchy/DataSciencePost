The following projects were developed in the **Enterprise Data Science and Analytics** Post-Graduation at NOVA Information Management School - University of Lisbon!

**MACHINE LEARNING**

[Deep Learning and Neural Networks](./machine_learning/deep_learning/predict_imdb_reviews.ipynb) <p>
Classification and regression projects applying neural networks only.

[Machine Learning (Unsupervised)](machine_learning/ml_unsupervised_learning/Deliverables/DSML_202223_Cluster_Group21_Notebook.ipynb) <p> 
The project follows a cross-industry process for data mining approach to uncover new opportunities for expanding the business while being better equipped to target existing customers groups. Spice Alley's customers were segmented through clustering algorithms. Customer profiling allows Spice Alley a better understanding of it's customers needs and behaviors. The questions that guided the project were the following:

    - What are Spice Alley customers segments? 
    - Which Spice Alley customer's features allows to distinguish their customers and consumption behavior?
    - What patterns/tendencies better allow us to segment Spice Alley customers? 

[Machine Learning (Supervised)](./machine_learning/ml_supervised_learning/Deliverables/DSML_202223_Predictive_Group21_Notebook.ipynb) <p> 
The project aims to predict if Spice Alley's customers will respond positively or negatively to Spice Alley's new product campaign. The models Neural Network, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression were applied to predict the response of Spice Alley's customers to a new marketing campaign. These models were trained using the historical data obtained from Spice Alley. The predictions were obtained based on the new customer data got from the answers to the new product campaing.  

**PYTHON**

[1 - Python Assigment:](./python/python_assignment.ipynb) 

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/c5f015.png) `1.1. Python basics` <p> 
Explore core building blocks of programming, focusing on variables, data structures, and their manipulation;

![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/c5f015.png) `1.2. K-Means from scratch` <p> 
Build an unsupervised learning algorithm step by step.

[2 - Webscrapping Project](./python/webscrapping_project) <p>
The projectâ€™s background goal is to collect the prices of the 25 items included in the Food Baskets: Operational Program to Support the Neediest People. We got the data of grocery products information with 16866 observations and eight features from 2 Portuguese supermarkets. By finding the best bargains among retailers, our analysis can assist customers in saving money. We divided the project into 3 major parts:

    2.1. Data Collection;
    2.2. Data Cleaning;
    2.3. Data Visualization and Analysis.

[T-SQL](./t-sql)

The project consist of working the Adventure Works database in two ways using Microsoft Azure:

[1. Online auction process in SQL](./t-sql/auction_script.sql) <p> 
We builted an auction schema in a CosmosDB database, created stored procedures for adding products to auction, bidding on a product, removing a product from auction, updating a product's auction status and creating lists of product's bidding history. 

[2. Brick-and-mortar stores](./t-sql/part_2/Part_2_script.sql) <p>
A comprehensive analysis of the database to develop data-driven arguments for a final proposition of the two best cities for Adventure Works to open the first 2 brick-and-mortar stores.
