## Project Summary
##### Our company ranks higher than the world average on employee attrition, wasting resources with turnover
- The company ranks 3 pp above the world average. This translates in an estimated annual cost of 20.7 million euros in the substitution process, plus indirect costs like employee demoralization and client dissatisfaction.
- To predict attrition, suggest strategies to lower its rate and, consequently, save resources, our team created a model, it can identify which employees are about to leave, which are the contributing factors and what makes an employee keep working on the company.
- To characterize and understand the reasons of employees that are about to leave, we classified all employees in groups with three distinct profiles.<br>

##### The predictive model can correctly identify 69% of employees in risk of leaving the company
- The factors contributing to increased attrition, in order of importance, include working overtime hours, frequent business travel, frequent company changes, lack of career progression, and having a long commute.
- The factors contributing to decrease attrition, in order of importance, include having a stable career (working for the company on the same role for longer), feeling involved on the job and be satisfied in the work, environment and relationship levels.

##### Current employees can be classified into three distinct groups, one of them in need of intervention
- Where’s the door? group - Requires immediate measures. Consists of 219 employees, all of them  leaving the company. High proportions of overtime and business traveling. Low job and environment satisfaction, low job involvement and live further away from the company.
 - Young go getters group – No action required. Consists of 817 employees, none leaving the company. Opposite of the latter group in terms of attrition predictors.
 - Old but gold group – Requires further investigation. Consists of 435 employees, only 19 (4%) leaving the company. Similar to the latter in terms of attrition predictors. Most of the elements with attrition are retirement cases  but others are lagging in career progression.

##### We can take immediate measures to retain current employees and forward-looking measures to gather data to make better decisions in the future 
- It’s important to increase the frequency of training sessions to reduce overtime, since less trained employees are more likely to do extra hours. It’s also important to gather more data to identify the causes and to know how many hours each worker is putting in, to tailor the solutions to the problems and improve the current model.
- We must reduce unnecessary business traveling, set travel policies to help offset its effects and increase employee rotation. Additionally, we need to gather more data to understand its frequency and if there are any notable thresholds.
- We need to improve employee performance evaluation and create personalized development plans to avoid career stagnation.
- To mitigate long commute effects, we can offer commuter benefits, like subsidizing a public transportation pass, promote remote work and flexible schedules.
- To avoid job hopping we can offer industry competitive compensation and benefits while providing opportunities for career and professional growth.

##### Work involvement, job, environment and relationship satisfaction offset effects of negative factors
- Total working years and number of years in the current role are the paramount factors to keep attrition low, indicating that employees with stable careers have a lesser probability of leaving the company.
- Fostering job involvement, job, environment and relationship satisfaction are the key to create and maintain a company where employees wish to stay and develop their skills and careers.
